The team&#39;s productivity and work-life balance has been one of the highest in the company.</p>

							<h3>Kristi Rigg</h3>
							<h3>CEO/Founder</h3>
							<h3>West Coast Centre for Learning</h3>
							<br>
							<p>&quot;I have had the pleasure of engaging Rob Bedard of Leadershift.Life in a personal capacity as a business professional and also to conduct team building workshops with our employees. I have found Rob to be insightful, engaging and a dynamic presenter. Before the workshop date, Rob goes the extra mile to learn about the team and utilizes the information in his workshop preparation. This is an important element as it personalizes the presentation for the team and creates buy-in.
							<p>Rob has the unique ability to make everyone in the room feel acknowledged and affirmed. This is an admirable quality and not one that many individuals possess. Rob&#39;s ability to personally connect with individuals in such a way is the reason he is so successful and good at what he does! It is without hesitation that I would recommend Rob as he is a gifted and talented presenter, facilitator and teacher.&quot;</p>

							<br>
							<p>&quot;I had an awesome opportunity to receive one-on-one coaching with Rob while serving in a volunteer leadership role. When I started working with Rob, I had no idea that I had already possessed many skills required in leadership. Rob was able to draw them out of me and assisted me in developing them to the point where I had the confidence to build a successful team around me. Rob was able to help me link leadership theory to leadership practice. He also helped me learn how to reflect on next steps and build momentum. Rob has a unique ability to connect with others and inspire them to grow to their potential. He cares about the people he works with and celebrates their successes, while supporting them through their leadership challenges.
							<p>The valuable leadership insights and tools Rob provided me not only assisted me in my volunteer role, but also in my career as a Social Worker. I would highly recommend Rob as a leadership mentor and coach for anyone who wants to grow in leadership and team development.&quot;</p>

							<br>
							<p>&quot;Rob is extremely knowledgeable and is a gifted and engaging communicator. It was so encouraging to be able to benefit from the knowledge and expertise of one of our very own faculty members.
							<p>We invited him to lead us through two days of team building exercises around the subject of &#39;Strengths-Based Leadership&#39; (i.e. StrengthsFinder). Rob facilitated two wonderful days with the team. The feedback was very positive, and best of all we&#39;ve been gifted with a common language and framework for engaging as a team while also arriving a deeper understanding of the unique gifts and abilities that each of our team members contribute to the whole.</p>
							<p>I have already recommended Rob to my colleagues who lead teams to take them through a similar exercise.&quot;</p>

							<h3>Sara Kraushar</h3>
							<h3>Academic Head of Schools</h3>
							<h3>Heritage Christian Online School / Flex Academy</h3>
							<br>
							<p>&quot;Rob has worked with a number of our teams providing Strengthfinders and Birkman Team Coaching. Our teams have found Rob&#39;s explanation of our personal abilities, team abilities and corporate abilities to be insightful and actionable. Rob helps bring out the best in people while challenging teams to build understanding, compassion and support for one another.</p>
							<p>Rob also worked with my child to do a Wired For Work Individualized Coaching Birkman session. My daughter had tried other career counselling and found the results did not resonate well with her, however, after working with Rob, she came away affirmed, grounded, and ready to pursue a career that &quot;fit&quot; her.&quot;</p>

							<br>
							<p>&quot;We had the privilege of having Rob lead a large group of our leaders through StrengthsFinder coaching. From beginning to end - in the consultation stage of assessing what our leaders may need, to the preparation, communications, presentation, and follow-up - Rob made the process very easy and enjoyable. He is willing to accommodate where necessary to serve our leaders best.</p>
							<p>Rob is intelligent and very knowledgeable, and at the same time, very approachable and fun -- easy to engage with. Our leaders greatly valued his insights and coaching, and his presentation was very clear, informed, and interactive! We would very much recommend Rob&#39;s leadership coaching!&quot;</p>
